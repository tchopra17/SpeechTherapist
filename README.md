# Talk to Mario: The Speech Correction Application.

Talk to Mario is the only application designed to help children with speech impediment issues. The application comprises of two streams that will help children practice their annunciation.

 * Lesson modules:
    * Lesson modules will first speak the sentences to the students, it will then ask the student to repeat the sentence to the application and analyze the studentâ€™s annunciation and provide a rating, and advice for improvement and practice sessions.

* Game modules: 
  * Game modules are speech guided. The game play is controlled by speech from the player. The player must pronounce the words correctly in order for the game sprites to be controlled. If the words are pronounced incorrectly the screen will show feedback for improvement.
